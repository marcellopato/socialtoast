1. **Document Storage:** Secure and scalable document storage on the cloud.
2. **Document Processing:** File transformations like PDF splitting or AI-based OCR based on project-specific rules.
3. A secure Web UI to manage and upload files (think OneDrive/Google Drive). 

## Aspects to Cover

- **Development Process**: How would you go about developing the application, and how you would leverage AI tools to be faster while keeping code quality.
- **Choice of Cloud Provider:** Select a cloud provider for the DMS solution.
- **Compute Platform Choice / Scalability / Performance:** Choose a compute platform and discuss scalability and performance considerations.
- **CI/CD & Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Define the CI/CD pipeline and infrastructure management strategy.
- **Observability & Metrics:** Discuss the monitoring and metrics strategy to track system performance and uptime.
- **Choice of Stack for Frontend, Backend, and other services:** Select the technology stack for the frontend, backend, and any other service you might want to use, explaining pros and cons of choices.
- **Architecture for File Processing:** Define the architecture for processing uploaded files.
- **Authentication Strategy (Web):** Explain the authentication strategy for both the web application and the upload agent.
- **Choice of Database**: Choose a database solution for storing document information and enabling search functionality.
